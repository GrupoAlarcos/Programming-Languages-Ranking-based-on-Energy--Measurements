## Sample Logs Folder
This folder contains an example of a log, to illustrate the raw data generated by the EET measurement instrument. 
- The json file contains the measurement information of the entity class.
- Each line of LPsc++_490_EX are the values obtained for id, time, monitor and DUT
- Each line of LPsc++_490_IN are the values obtained for id, time, HDD(),HDD(2), Graphics card(1), Graphics card(2),Processor(1) and Processor(2).
DUT hardware components have two values because they have two sensors connected, the result of the DUT hardware component is the sum of the two values.

Note: The rest of the logs of this study are not included in the repository for practical reasons, due to their large size.
